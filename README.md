# Nashville
SharpestMinds project examining Davidson County TN real estate data.
Includes a webscraper for collecting home sales data from http://www.padctn.org/, formatting it and creating a .csv from it, a LightGBM regressor for predicting the price per square foot of a home, then an interactive Bokeh app for estimating the price of a house in Nashville.

Also included is an analysis of the data, with distributions and correlations of the features and how they relate to the price per square foot.

In progress: PCA and clustering.
